# Adding Your Profile Image

## Instructions:

1. **Save your profile photo** as `profile.jpg` in the `assets/images/` folder
2. **The image should be:**
   - Named exactly: `profile.jpg`
   - Located at: `assets/images/profile.jpg`
   - Recommended size: 500x500 pixels or larger (square format works best)
   - Format: JPG, PNG, or WebP

## Quick Setup:

1. Drag and drop your image file into the `assets/images/` folder
2. Rename it to `profile.jpg`
3. Refresh your website to see the changes

## Alternative: Use macOS Terminal (if needed):

```bash
# Navigate to your project directory
cd /Users/parveenkumar/creative-portfolio-website

# Copy your image file (replace 'path/to/your/image.jpg' with actual path)
cp path/to/your/image.jpg assets/images/profile.jpg
```

## The website will automatically:
- Display your photo in a circular frame with orange gradient border
- Add hover effects and animations
- Make it responsive across all devices
- Show a shimmer effect

Once you've added the image, the placeholder icon will be replaced with your actual photo!
